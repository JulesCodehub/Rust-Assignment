# Rust-Assignment
Modules 1 and 2 code

Up untill submission I was utilizing the rand crate for module 1 assignment 3 to give random input.
I largely used rust playground instead of code spaces, since it automatically handled crates, but I pushed my changes as frequently as I saw fit.
I was going to replace it with a version of newtons method for a more elegant solution, but no specific bounds for the integers were given or seemingly required, so I hope this simple increment is adequate.
